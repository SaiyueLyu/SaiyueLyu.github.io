This project aims to understand the temporal and multilingual dynamics after catastrophic crisis disaster. We look into a case: Fukushima Nuclear disaster in 2011. We examined corresponding Twitter discourse in different languages about the nuclear disaster in 2011 and the follow-up discharge of the stored water until 2021.

Specificly, I queried Twitter data from 2011 to 2021 in four languages using Twitter API V2. After preprocessing the row data, I built up a BERT classifier trying to filtered the sarcasm tweets. Then I utilized other NLP techniques including sentiment analysis and topic modeling to identify the dominant topics of the nuclear disaster, post-disaster discourses, and the public attitudes towards these topics in different time phases. Our work revealed multilingual disparities of post-disaster discourse dynamics and the regional public attitudes towards the post-disaster management in a long run. A paper is submitted to WWW'22. More details to come.
