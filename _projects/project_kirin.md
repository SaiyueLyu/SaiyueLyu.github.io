This is a group course project for Information Visualization : [Course Report](https://saiyuelyu.github.io/assets/pdf/Kirin.pdf), [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHhpQP-oc9U)

Ethereum is a popular blockchain-based software platform that supports transacting values and interacting between users and Decentralized Finance applications (DeFi apps) but lacks visualization systems to reveal temporal dynamics of users interactions. We conducted interviews to understand users' need to compare different metrics and protocols within a selected time period. After querying data from blockchain analysis API and pre-processing them, we built up a web-based interactive visualization prototype based on the user-centered design methodology to support expert users and also attract new users.
