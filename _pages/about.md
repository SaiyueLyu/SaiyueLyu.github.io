I am a master student in the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} at [The University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} supervised by Prof. [Mark Giesbrecht](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mwg){:target="\_blank"}. I completed my unergraduate degree at Waterloo in [Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/){:target="\_blank"} and [Combinatorics & Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/){:target="\_blank"}. My mathematical foundation gives me important tools to approach the advanced algorithmic techniques used in Machine Learning. I also worked with Prof. [Zhicong Lu](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/){:target="\_blank"} on Computational Social Science.

I will be joining the University of British Columbia as a Computer Science Ph.D. student in Fall2022 to work on privacy preserving machine learning:)
