I am a master student in the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} at [The University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} supervised by Prof. [Mark Giesbrecht](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mwg){:target="\_blank"}. I completed my unergraduate degree at Waterloo in [Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/){:target="\_blank"} and [Combinatorics & Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/){:target="\_blank"}. My mathematical foundation gives me important tools to approach the advanced algorithmic techniques used in areas like Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also work with Prof. [Zhicong Lu](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/){:target="\_blank"} in Computational Social Science.

I am interested in ultilizing Natural Language Processing to understand human behaviors and communication, and developing computational methods and innovative design tools to combine human's perception and machine automation to enhance creativity.

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
