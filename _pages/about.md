I am a master student in the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} at [The University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca){:target="\_blank"} supervised by Prof. [Mark Giesbrecht](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mwg){:target="\_blank"}. I completed my unergraduate degree at Waterloo in [Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/){:target="\_blank"} and [Combinatorics & Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/){:target="\_blank"}. My mathematical foundation gives me important tools to approach the advanced algorithmic techniques used in areas like Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also work with Prof. [Zhicong Lu](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/){:target="\_blank"} on Computational Social Science.

I am interested in utilizing Natural Language Processing to understand human behaviors and communication, and developing computational methods and innovative design tools to combine human's perception and machine automation to enhance creativity.
